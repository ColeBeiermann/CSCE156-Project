# CSCE156-Project Things to Do:

- Reallign results and numbers evenly

- Calculate special cases for MovieTickets and ParkingPass
   (MovieTickets) Tuesday and Thursday- 7% off
   (ParkingPass) If pass has corresponding ticket code or season ticket, pass cost is waived
   
- Output to txt file instead of displaying result

- Use encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and interface
